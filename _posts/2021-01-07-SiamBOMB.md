## Abstract

Biologists often need to handle numerous video-based home-cage animal behavior analysis tasks that require massive workloads. Therefore, we develop an AI-based multi-species tracking and segmentation system, SiamBOMB, for real-time and automatic home-cage animal behavioral analysis. In this system, a background-enhanced Siamese-based network with replaceable modular design ensures the flexibility and generalizability of the system, and a user-friendly interface makes it convenient to use for biologists. This real-time AI system will effectively reduce the burden on biologists.
